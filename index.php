<!-- The idea here is to show what is needed depending on server state -->
<!-- Initial state shows an admin login, which leads to ./admin after login to configure and control things -->
<!-- When the admin has 'opened up sign in', this page will show the sign in -->
<!-- After sign in is closed, this page will switch to score entry -->
